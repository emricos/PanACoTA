# PanACOTA is a software providing tools for large scale bacterial comparative  #
# genomics. From a set of complete and/or draft genomes, you can:               #
#    -  Do a quality control of your strains, to eliminate poor quality         #
# genomes, which would not give any information for the comparative study       #
#    -  Uniformly annotate all genomes                                          #
#    -  Do a Pan-genome                                                         #
#    -  Do a Core or Persistent genome                                          #
#    -  Align all Core/Persistent families                                      #
#    -  Infer a phylogenetic tree from the Core/Persistent families             #

    """
    Build a file or directory containing all proteins of all genomes contained in lstinfo.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lstinfo : str
        1 line per genome, only 1st column considered here, as the genome name
        without extension
    dbpath : str
        Proteins folder, containing all proteins for each genome. Each genome has
        its own protein file, called `<genome_name>.prt`.
    name : str
        dataset name, used to name the output databank: <outdir>/<name>.All.prt
    spedir : str or None
        By default, output file is saved in dbpath directory. If it must be saved somewhere
        else, it is specified here.
    quiet : bool
        True if nothing must be written in stdout/stderr, False otherwise
    dir : bool
        If True, create a folder with required genomes instead of pulling them to one file. Some pangenome building
        methods require such format.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        name (with path) of the protein databank generated
